# Illuminator
Illuminator is a simple Reflection library for Java. It is both an attempt to avoid the verboseness of the standard Reflection library and an exercise in learning for the author.

# Getting started with Illuminator

Illuminator is in an extremely early form right now. To get ahold of, and to test the code please follow these instructions.

First, clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/williammartin/illuminator.git

Then, navigate into the illuminator project directory and run:

    mvn test

You must have maven installed and available on your path or the previous step will fail.

Good luck!
